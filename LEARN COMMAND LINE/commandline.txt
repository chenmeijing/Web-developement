The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

##Navigating the filesystem
1.pwd Print Working Directory 
  -The shell command pwd displays the file path from the root directory to the current working directory.

2.mkdir Make Directory
  -The shell command mkdir is used to make a new directory in the filesystem according to its argument. If a file path is given, the new directory will be placed at the end. Otherwise, it will create a new directory in the current working directory.

3.ls List
  -The shell command ls is used to list the contents of a directory. If no arguments are given, it will list the contents of the current working directory.

4.cd Change Directory
  -The shell command cd is used to move throughout the filesystem of a computer. It accepts a variety of arguments:
    -Full file paths.
    -Names of children of the current directory.
    -.. the parent of the current directory.

5.Filesystem Structure
  -A computer’s filesystem organizes the data stored by a computer, so that it can be easily retrieved by the user.
Files are generally represented in a tree-like structure, in which any parent directory can have any number of children. The root directory is then found at the base of the tree.

6.touch Create New File
-The shell command touch creates a new file in the current working directory with the name provided.

7.The Command Line
-The command line allows a user to navigate the filesystem and run built-in programs or custom scripts. In Unix, the command line interface is called Bash, and the shell prompt is the $.

8.Helper Commands
  -Helper commands for the command line include:
    clear to clear the terminal
    tab to autocomplete the line
    ↑ and ↓ to cycle through previous commands

##Viewing and Changing the File System
9.Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt

10.To copy, move, and remove files and directories:
    cp copies files
    mv moves and renames files
    rm removes files
    rm -r removes directories
    Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories


##Redirecting Input and Output
11.standard input, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device. standard output, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run. standard error, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.
